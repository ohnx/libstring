    ABOUT
        libstring is a simple flexible string manipulation library,
        written in C. All library functions are able to take both
        C-style char arrays and libstring-style strings as input
        (output from is always libstring-style strings).

    LIBSTRING-STYLE STRINGS
        libstring-style strings can be treated as normal C-style
        strings. (ie, all C str* functions are compatible with
        libstring-style strings, provided they do not increase the
        length of the string)
        
        How does this work? Well, libstring-style strings are actually
        char arrays. However, they 

    BUILDING
        Run `make` on systems with make and gcc. This will generate a
        file `libstring.a`. To test libstring, you can also run
        `make test` to compile and run the tests.

    DOCUMENTATION
        Run `make docs` on systems with make and doxygen. This will
        generate the HTML and LaTeX documentation in the folder `docs/`
