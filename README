                a simple flexible string manipulation library

    ABOUT
        libstring is a simple flexible string manipulation library,
        written in C89. All library functions are able to take both
        C-style char arrays and libstring-style strings as input
        (output from is always libstring-style strings).

        libstring keeps track of memory - so you don't have to!
        The only time when you need to manual memory manage is when
        freeing a string.

    ARRAY SUPPORT
        Unfortunately, libstring does not support arrays. This is
        due to the unique structure of a string representation in
        libstring (see below). However, it is possible to have an
        array of pointers to libstring-compatible strings. To do so,
        you will require pointers to `string_real`, and not `string`.

    LIBSTRING-STYLE STRINGS
        libstring-style strings can be treated as normal C-style
        strings. (ie, all C str* functions are compatible with
        libstring-style strings, provided they do not increase the
        length of the string)
        
        How does this work? Well, libstring-style strings are actually
        char arrays. However, they have an extra header in front.
        When you call a libstring function, it returns only a pointer
        to the char array afterwards - not the header. This means that
        you can call functions that expect a char array by passing
        them any libstring-returned string.

        Internally, these strings are represented by a struct of type
        `string_real`. See the documentation generated by doxygen for
        more information on how libstring works behind the scenes.

    BUILDING
        Run `make` on systems with make and gcc. This will generate a
        file `libstring.a`. To test libstring, you can also run
        `make test` to compile and run the tests.

    DOCUMENTATION
        Run `make docs` on systems with make and doxygen. This will
        generate the HTML and LaTeX documentation in the folder `docs/`
