                a simple flexible string manipulation library

    ABOUT
        libstring is a simple flexible string manipulation library,
        written in C89. All library functions are able to take both
        C-style char arrays and libstring-style strings as input
        (output from is always libstring-style strings).

        libstring keeps track of memory when appending strings -
        so you don't have to! The only time when you need to manual
        memory manage is when you're done with a string.

    LIBSTRING-STYLE STRINGS
        libstring-style strings can be treated as normal C-style
        strings. (ie, all C str* functions are compatible with
        libstring-style strings, provided they do not increase the
        length of the string)
        
        How does this work? Well, libstring-style strings are actually
        char arrays. However, they have an extra header in front.
        When you call a libstring function, it returns only a pointer
        to the char array afterwards - not the header. This means that
        you can call functions that expect a char array by passing
        them any libstring-returned string.

        If you are concerned about reads before the start of a string,
        string_mknew() will always assume the string passed in to it
        is a non library-compatible string, and return a pointer to a
        newly-allocated library-comptabile string.

        Internally, these strings are represented by a struct of type
        `string_real`. See the documentation generated by doxygen for
        more information on how libstring works behind the scenes.

    BUILDING
        Run `make` on systems with make and gcc. This will generate a
        file `libstring.a`. To test libstring, you can also run
        `make test` to compile and run the tests.

    DOCUMENTATION
        Run `make docs` on systems with make and doxygen. This will
        generate the HTML and LaTeX documentation in the folder `docs/`

    LICENSE
        MIT-licensed, see the LICENSE file.

    A NOTE ON PRINTF
        libstring's printf implementation relies on va_copy, which
        is not part of c89. Instead, it is available as an extension.
        To compile libstring with printf support, run `make printf`.
